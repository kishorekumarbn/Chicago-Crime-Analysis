# Chicago-Crime-Analysis
This project analyzes crime data to uncover trends and insights, visualized in Power BI. It includes temporal analysis, geospatial mapping, and crime type distribution to make data-driven decisions


This project focuses on analyzing crime data to uncover insights and patterns using Python and Power BI. It involves cleaning the data, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and visualizing crime trends effectively.
Key Features

    Data Cleaning:
        Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.
        Handled missing values and formatted date fields.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Yearly, monthly, and hourly crime trends.
        Analysis of crime types and arrest patterns.
        Insights into domestic vs. non-domestic crimes.

    Visualizations with Python:
        Bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
        Geospatial analysis of crime hotspots using maps.

    Power BI Dashboards:
        Interactive dashboards showing trends, crime hotspots, and arrest patterns.
        Filters to analyze data by location, time, and crime type.

Tools and Libraries Used

    Python: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy.
    Power BI: For interactive dashboards and storytelling.

How to Run the Project

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/kishorekumarbn/crime-analysis.git

Install the required Python libraries:

    pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy

    Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts for EDA and visualizations.
    Open the Power BI file to explore interactive dashboards.

Insights

    Peak crime hours and days were identified.
    Arrests were more likely for specific crime types.
    Domestic incidents showed distinct trends compared to non-domestic ones.
    High-crime locations were highlighted for further investigation.

Future Scope

    Adding machine learning for crime prediction.
    Enhancing geospatial analysis with clustering techniques.
    Automating updates for new crime datasets.
